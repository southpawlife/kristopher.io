_Note: Languages listed indicate languages that I have written in, but not necessarily mastered. I do not think an engineer needs to have mastery
of a language to be competent. In fact, I find it to be more ideal to be able to move from language to language, learning quickly
what is needed rather than trying to use a comfortable language to solve all problems._
