      <h1>Kristopher Williams</h1>
      <p>
        Welcome to my little corner of the web.
      </p>
      <p>
        This site acts as a test bed for my tinkering online, 
        as well as my Nth attempt at a personal blog. Born and raised in the greater Seattle area, 
        most of my childhood was spent in Snohomish, Washington, USA. I went to college at 
        Seattle Pacific University, where I got my Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Science, 
        with a minor in Computer Engineering.
      </p>
      <p>
        In 2012 I moved to Kansas City, MO, and worked for the health software company, Cerner Corporation. 
        Among other tasks, I worked on writing big-data processing pipelines, and designing REST APIs 
        for Cerner's HealtheIntent Platform.
      </p>
      <p>
        As of 2019 I relocated back to the Seattle area with my wife, and now work for Microsoft on their cloud platform Azure.
        On the side, I work remotely on the geni-act.org. This is a research platform for undergraduate students, 
        and instructors to be able to contribute to novel research projects. This project is currently NSF funded, 
        but I have been striving to create a sustainable business model. It has been a project I have been 
        contributing to for the last 10 years.
