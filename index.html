        Welcome to my little corner of the web.

      </p>
      <p>
        Born and raised in the greater Seattle area, most of my childhood was spent in Snohomish, 
        Washington, USA. I went to college at Seattle Pacific University, where I got my Bachelor 
        of Science degree in Computer Science, with a minor in Computer Engineering.
      </p>
      <p>
        In 2012 I moved to Kansas City, MO, and worked for the health software company, Cerner. 
        Among other tasks, I worked on writing big-data processing pipelines and designing REST 
        APIs for Cerner's HealtheIntent Platform.
      </p>
      <p>
        As of 2019, I have relocated back to the Seattle area with my wife and now work on the Azure 
        platform for Microsoft. Specificly, I am working on helping bring baremetal workflows to the cloud. 
      </p>
      <p>
        On the side, I work remotely for geni-act.org. This is a research platform for undergraduate students, 
        and instructors to be able to contribute to novel research projects. This project is currently NSF funded, 
        but I have been striving to create a sustainable business model. It has been a project I have been 
        contributing to for the last 10 years.
      </p>
