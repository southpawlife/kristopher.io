Welcome to my corner of the web!
<br /><br />
This site acts as a test bed for my tinkering online, as well as my Nth attempt at a personal blog.
<br /><br />
Born and raised in the greater Seattle area, most of my childhood was spent in Snohomish, Washington, USA. I went to college at Seattle
Pacific University, where I got my Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Science, with a minor in Computer Engineering.
<br /><br />
In 2012 I moved to Kansas City, MO, and worked for the health software company, Cerner Corporation. Among other tasks, I worked on writing big-data processing pipelines, and designing REST APIs for Cerner's HealtheIntent Platform.

Still residing in Kansas City today, I work remotely on the [geni-act.org](geni-act.org). This is a research platform for undergraduate students, and instructors to be able to contribute to novel research projects. This project is currently NSF funded, but I have been striving to create a sustainable business model. It has been a project I have been contributing to for the last 10 years.
<br /><br />
My wife and I are currently looking to relocate to the Seattle area, and I am actively looking for senior level Software Engineering positions in the Northwest.
