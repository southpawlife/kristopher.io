Welcome to my corner of the web. I am Kristopher.
<br /><br />
This site acts as a test bed for my tinkering online, as well as my nth attempt at a personal blog.
<br /><br />
Born and raised in the greater Seattle area, most of my childhood was spent in Snohomish, Washington, USA. I went to college at Seattle
Pacific University, where I got my Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Science, with a minor in Computer Engineering.
<br /><br />
Currently, I live in Kansas City, MO, writing big-data processing pipelines, and designing REST APIs, for Cerner Corporation's HealtheIntent Platform.
