Welcome to my corner of the web. My name, if you had not already figured it out, is Kristopher. Some call me Kris, but I always write out Kristopher. Use whichever you prefer. I currently live in Kansas City, MO, and work for <a href="http://www.cerner.com/" title="cerner.com">Cerner</a>.

Born and raised in the greater Seattle area, I will always call that home. Most of my childhood was spent in Snohomish, WA. I look forward to someday moving back in the great Northwest.

Until I add more information, if you want to get in touch feel free to drop me an <a href="mailto:email@kristopher.io">email</a>. I have also have been known to tweet from time to time, on all sorts of topics. (programming, politics, space exploration, beer, Seahawks, etc...) So if that is more your style, follow <a href="https://twitter.com/southpawlife"> @southpawlife</a>.
