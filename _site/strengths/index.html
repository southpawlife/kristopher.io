  <h1 class="page-title">Strengths</h1>
  <p>The following strengths were found using <a href="http://strengths.gallup.com/110440/about-strengthsfinder-20.aspx">Strengths Finder 2.0</a>, a book/test that was recommended to me by a coworker. I believe they are spot on representations of my character which is why I chose to share them.</p>

<h1 id="ideation">Ideation</h1>

<p>People who are especially talented in the Ideation theme are fascinated by ideas. They are able to
find connections between seemingly disparate phenomena.</p>

<h3 id="what-makes-you-stand-out">What makes you stand out?</h3>

<p>Chances are good that you recharge your mind by creating ideas for new projects. This occurs even
before you have completed your current assignment. You are happiest when you can hand off your
unfinished work to others. You are like a surgeon who performs the operation but asks a competent
assistant close the patient’s incision. You have ways of freeing yourself to think about your next
project. Instinctively, you bring new thoughts to most discussions and meetings. Your reputation for
innovative thinking explains why you are recruited by groups. You derive satisfaction from mental
activity. You recognize when you are especially creative. Driven by your talents, you are occasionally
concerned about what individuals might think of you. Perhaps you want them to recognize your ability
to involve different kinds of people in certain groups or specific activities. It’s very likely that you enjoy
spending time with possibility thinkers. This is often the case when they present intriguing ideas that
no one else has considered. You enjoy exploring the fascinating frontiers of medicine, politics,
fashion, renewable energy sources, humanitarian aid, or the arts. Because of your strengths, you
contribute many innovative ideas to the group during brainstorming sessions. You tend to be highly
imaginative when proposals are fully heard and any criticism is reserved for a later time.</p>

<h1 id="learner">Learner</h1>

<p>People who are especially talented in the Learner theme have a great desire to learn and want to
continuously improve. In particular, the process of learning, rather than the outcome, excites them.</p>

<h3 id="what-makes-you-stand-out-1">What makes you stand out?</h3>

<p>It’s very likely that you can finagle — that is, obtain by indirect or involved means — time with people
who think about the coming years and decades. Routinely, you read their writings or listen to their
conversations. You probably ask them questions and consider their responses. You file away lots of
ideas and facts, sensing that one day this information will prove to be useful. Whether it ever actually
does become useful makes no difference to you. Collecting the predictions of forward-looking thinkers
is apt to be rewarding in and of itself. Chances are good that you yearn to know a lot. It makes little
sense to you to skim through a book and read only the highlights. You delve more deeply into
intriguing subjects than most people do. You love to gather all kinds of information. This explains why
you take time to grasp ideas that appear in print. Because of your strengths, you might search for the
factors that produced a certain outcome or started a particular chain of events. Sometimes you are
frustrated until you figure out why things happened the way they did. Instinctively, you usually equate
education — formal and informal — with understanding more about something today than you
understood about it yesterday. By nature, you long to know more so you remain on the cutting edge of
your field or areas of interest. Your inventive mind usually generates more possibilities than you can
handle or fund. Nonetheless, you are committed to acquiring knowledge and/or skills. You study
everything involved in a situation and conceive entirely new ways of seeing or doing things. What you
already know prompts you to ask questions and delve even deeper into a subject or problem.</p>

<h1 id="input">Input</h1>

<p>People who are especially talented in the Input theme have a craving to know more. Often they like to
collect and archive all kinds of information.</p>

<h3 id="what-makes-you-stand-out-2">What makes you stand out?</h3>

<p>It’s very likely that you continually seek wisdom from people with whom you have intelligent
conversations. You not only listen but also share your thoughts. In the process, you are likely to move
beyond concrete facts. Your curiosity draws you to speculate — that is, reflect or wonder — about
theories, ideas, or concepts. To keep your mind fresh, you frequently quiz individuals who are equally
fascinated with the intangible and abstract aspects of life. Chances are good that you pay close
attention to current events. Numerous people merely recount what they heard, saw, or read. Typically
you dive deeper into the topic. You are likely to generate theories, concepts, or philosophies to
explain the reasoning behind newsmakers’ decisions. You routinely gather information about events,
policy statements, people, or crises. Your fresh insights are likely to draw equally engaged thinkers
into the conversation. Because of your strengths, you may rely on reason to enlighten individuals
about the intricacies of issues, processes, events, problems, or decisions. You occasionally detect
nuances in data or information that certain people overlook. Perhaps you derive some degree of
pleasure from bringing particular facts, points, or circumstances to the attention of others. Driven by
your talents, you are willing to spend time sharing your ideas with intelligent individuals. Of course,
you want them to tell you their latest thinking. Conversations that involve a lot of questions and
answers stimulate your mind. You know you have spent your time wisely when you have a number of
new ideas, theories, or concepts to somehow file away or remember for future use. Instinctively, you
have a deep yearning to acquire more knowledge and gain new skills to heighten your expertise.
Usually you desire to be in the know — that is, completely educated about your area of specialization.
Not surprisingly, you suffer greatly when an information vacuum exists or you are left out of the
information loop.</p>

<h1 id="strategic">Strategic</h1>

<p>People who are especially talented in the Strategic theme create alternative ways to proceed. Faced
with any given scenario, they can quickly spot the relevant patterns and issues.</p>

<h3 id="what-makes-you-stand-out-3">What makes you stand out?</h3>

<p>Instinctively, you can reconfigure factual information or data in ways that reveal trends, raise issues,
identify opportunities, or offer solutions. You bring an added dimension to discussions. You make
sense out of seemingly unrelated information. You are likely to generate multiple action plans before
you choose the best one. Because of your strengths, you may have little difficulty finding the right
words at the right time to express what you are thinking or feeling. Maybe you can present your
concepts in a reasonable, orderly, or methodical way. Perhaps you generate a few options for others
to consider. As a result, certain individuals might say you know how to get your ideas across to
people. By nature, you may easily find the right words to express what you are thinking. Sometimes
you offer explanations. Occasionally you discuss ideas. Once in a while, you rely on examples,
stories, or jokes to illustrate your main points. Driven by your talents, you have acquired valuable skills
and knowledge. You spend time considering numerous courses of action before choosing one. You
invent original and innovative techniques for dealing with expected and unexpected challenges. You
use the same approach to take advantage of promising opportunities. Chances are good that you
might appreciate straightforward, plainspoken, and concise conversations. Sometimes you engage in
dialogue people who are willing to listen to the alternatives you present.</p>

<h1 id="intellection">Intellection</h1>

<p>People who are especially talented in the Intellection theme are characterized by their intellectual
activity. They are introspective and appreciate intellectual discussions.</p>

<h3 id="what-makes-you-stand-out-4">What makes you stand out?</h3>

<p>Chances are good that you derive much pleasure from pondering things deeply. After much
forethought, you customarily reach conclusions, offer new ideas, suggest different ways of looking at
situations, or ask probing questions. Instinctively, you traditionally want to think with visionaries. You
are quite comfortable with long stretches of silence. Why? Quiet allows you and the others to mull
over theories or create inventions that can alter the course of history or change the way ordinary
people live. It’s very likely that you occasionally go off by yourself to think through things. Because of
your strengths, you occasionally spend time alone thinking about which individuals work well together.
Perhaps your thoughtful examination of each human being allows you to mix and match the strengths
of several individuals. Sometimes the strengths of one person compensate for the limitations of
another person, and vice versa. You might conclude that a group’s true strength lies in the diversity of
its members’ knowledge, skills, motivations, work styles, or thinking styles. Driven by your talents, you
take time to reflect on important topics or issues. Your thinking becomes more expansive whenever
you delve into your areas of expertise or consider your specialized skills.</p>
